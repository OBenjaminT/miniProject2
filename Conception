What should be mentionned : 
    les éventuelles modifications personnelles que vous avez apportées à l'architecture proposée en les justifiant;
    les classes/interfaces ajoutées et comment elles s'insèrent dans l'architecture;
    le comportement que vous attribuez à chacun des composants introduits (si le composant n'est pas demandé ou s'il l'est mais que son comportement est une petite variante de celui suggéré dans l'énoncé).

Be CONCISE and if necessary, you can just ref the green commentaries we put above methods
Also, for things were we stricly folowed the instructions, you can just say that

Part One:
-Explain our conception of ICWarsActor :
  -the fact we deciceed to use an enumeration for Faction
  -our leaveArea/EnterArea method
  -etc
  
-Explain our conception of units for part 1:
    -the abstract Unit class that we deciced to put abstract because there can t be an instance of the object
    -explain the methods we decided to put in unit because they are both inhereted by Tank and Soldier(so that we avoid the code repetition)
    -explain the way we created the constructors of unit/Soldier/Tank
    -if you see sth else that seems important to talk about for the part 2.2.1
    -explain how we get the right name for the unit's sprite in Tank and Soldier with the method that checks what the faction of the unit is
    -etc
    
-Initiation of levels:
  -explain how the units are given to the player when he enters the game
  -explain how you determined their spawn position (all the bonus things you created with the hashmap)
  
-Explain our conception of the ICWarsPlayer for part 1:
  -maybe we should put it as abstract and explain why or why not
  -how the player's unit are initiated ( with the list ) and how there are registered in the area ( RegisterUnitsAsActors method)
  -how in the update method the dead units are eliminated : created the isDead/isAlive mthod in the units + need to remove the units both from
  the player's unit list and from the area
  -the leaveArea and enterArea method
  -how we can center the camera on the player
  -how we get the right sprite name depending on the faction (same thing as for the units) (in the instruction
  it was said we should to this in realPlayer but we did it here because it is the same thing for the AIPlayer)
  -what we did for checking if a player was defeated
  -etc
  
  -Explain our conception of the RealPlayer for part 1:
    -how we make him move
    -etc
 
 -Explain our conception of ICWars for part 1:
    -the interesting things we did for part 1 (the eg the begin/initArea)
    -how the N keyboard functionnality works with also an explanation of the method nextArea()
    -same for R
  
 -Explain the graphic infos for part 1:
    -how we create the units range
    -How the player can select a unit (just say that it is in the later part that we really implement this with the interactions between a player and a unit)
    -how the player can draw the path of the unit thanks to his PlayerGUI
    -what we did for when the U button is pressed
    -how we respected the constraints for this part (see part 2.4 of the instructions) and check if the way the GUI receives the selected unit is great and explain why we did it like this
    
  
  
 Part 2:
 
 -Explain the States of the player for part 2 (so everything except the things related to the actions)
    -the enum we did for the states
    -for details you can go into details for the MOVE_UNIT state and explain how we set units already moved + the changePosition method
    -quickly the RealPlayerCanMove method
    -quickly the override of onleaving and the startTurn method
    -breifly the switch in draw
    
 -Explain our interractions structure:
    -explain how we created the interface ICWarsInteractionVisitor with default interaction methods 
    -RealsPlayer implements interractor, he has a private class ICWarsUnitInteractionHandler that handles the interactions (explain breifly the important methods in this class),
    he has an attribute handler...
    -explain the the acceptInteraction method we implemented in unit 
    -explain the way a unit is selected and transmitted to the playerGUI too
    -explain how the oppacity of the used units's sprite is changed
    
-Explain the game state:
    -the different lists of players we have (the one that contains all the players, the one that contains those waiting for next turn and for the current turn)
    -the way we remove players from the list
    -the endTurn method 
    -the TAB button
    
Part 3:
-Explain what we did for the actions:
    -the inheritance process between actable, action, attack and wait
    -quickly go over the doAction of Wait
    -for attack, the doAction (focus on the fact that for the encapsulation, most of the process is done by the area)
    explain also the attack method in doAction and what is important is to focus on the fact we deciced to make the units interractors
    so that when interacting with a cell they can get the number of stars in it, which is important in the calculus when a unit takes dammage
    -the action list in the units
 
 -Explain what we did for the actions with the RealPlayer:
    -the things related to actions in update of real Player
    -the panels that are drawn by the GUI (explain the interact with a cell in ICWarsPlayerInteractionHandler and the mthods that draw the panels in the GUI)
    
-Explain the AIPlayer :
    -the switch in the AIplayer update
    -the doAutoAction for the actions (especially for the attack explain how moveUnitTowardsClosestEnnemy works, see the comments for the algorythme that moves the unit)
